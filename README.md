# Visualization Dashboard (Latitude Analysis)

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! The purpose of this 7 page Visualization Dashboard is to display the outcome of the analysis of how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. This analysis uses the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
